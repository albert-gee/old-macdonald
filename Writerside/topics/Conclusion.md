# Conclusion

The project has successfully implemented key components, including a Matter-compatible temperature and pressure sensor
using the BMP280, a humidity sensor, and a relay switch for environmental control. These devices were integrated with
ESP32 microcontrollers and configured to communicate via the Matter protocol, with a Raspberry Pi serving as the
commissioning controller. These implementations lay the foundation for a scalable and decentralized precision
agriculture solution.

Future work will focus on integrating additional sensors, such as CO2 and light intensity sensors, and implementing
advanced actuators like automated irrigation systems and adjustable LED grow lights. The Raspberry Pi will be replaced
with an ESP32-C6 orchestrator, and the SCADA system will be enhanced for cloud-based deployment, enabling real-time
monitoring, control, and scalability.
