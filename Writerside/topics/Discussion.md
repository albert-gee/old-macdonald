To enable seamless operation, the system leverages the Matter protocol, which ensures compatibility between devices from
different manufacturers. This standardisation simplifies integration, replacement, and future expansion of devices.
However, the high costs associated with Matter certification – including
a \$7,000 annual membership fee for the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) and $3,000 per product certification –
pose significant challenges for small manufacturers and farms operating on tight budgets.

Future advancements in this system could include the adoption of microfluidics within hydroponic systems. Such
developments would enhance resource efficiency and allow for precise control over environmental conditions tailored to
specific crops. These innovations align with the system’s modular design philosophy, which prioritises adaptability and
scalability in agricultural automation.
