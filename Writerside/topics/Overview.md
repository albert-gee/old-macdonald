# Overview

This project focuses on creating a decentralised Controlled Environment Agriculture system.

The system has a modular structure and operates without a central hub. Each module manages its own sub-network of
accessory devices such as sensors (e.g., temperature and humidity sensors) and actuators (e.g., mist makers and
thermostats).

This decentralised system enables the devices to operate autonomously by making localised decisions based on real-time
environmental data. For instance, when a temperature sensor detects a change, it directly commands a thermostat to
adjust the environment accordingly.

The system prioritises interoperability to ensure easy integration of new devices from different manufacturers and the
replacement of existing ones without major updates. It also implements strong security measures to guarantee safe data
transmission and access control, enhancing the system's resilience and scalability.
