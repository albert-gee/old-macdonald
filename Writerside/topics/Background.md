# Background

Precision Agriculture and Wireless Sensor Networks are key technologies driving automation in agriculture. The Internet
of Things (IoT) has made crop monitoring easier and more efficient, boosting farmers' productivity and profits.

However, many farming automation startups struggle to succeed. One major challenge is the high cost of research and
development. Building advanced automation systems requires significant investment, which often raises food prices,
making it hard for startups to compete with traditional farms that have much lower operational costs.

Automated farms often rely on expensive centralised servers or cloud resources for data processing and control. This
setup requires complex communication infrastructure and significant coordination, which increases costs and complicates
scalability for larger farms.

Another issue is the difficulty of integrating components from different manufacturers. Automated farms use a variety of
sensors, actuators, and equipment, but differences in APIs and communication protocols can make it challenging to
connect these systems smoothly.

Additionally, reliance on centralised systems creates a single point of failure. If the central server or cloud service
fails or is compromised, the entire operation can be disrupted. For example, an AWS IoT outage in 2020 caused major
downtime for several applications relying on AWS IoT Core, highlighting the risks of depending on a single hub.
