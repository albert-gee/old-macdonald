# Orchestrator

Raspberry Pi plays the role of an Orchestrator for testing purposes. It runs an application named CHIP Tool (chip-tool) which is a Matter controller implementation that allows to commission a Matter device into the network and to communicate with it using Matter messages. 

An Orchestrator will later be implemented on ESP32-C6 and replace the Raspberry Pi device.
