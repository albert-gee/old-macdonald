# Websocket Server

## Overview

The Orchestrator device uses WebSocket to exchange messages with connected clients.

This section outlines the development of the **Websocket Server** component.

## Development

### Bootstrap Component {collapsible="true"}

The command below creates a new component named `websocket_server` inside the `components` directory.

```Bash
idf.py create-component websocket_server -C components
```

Change the file extension of the `websocket_server.c` file to `websocket_server.cpp` and move it
to the `src` folder.

```Bash
mv components/matter_controller_interface/matter_controller_interface.c components/matter_controller_interface/src/matter_controller_interface.cpp
```

Enable WebSocket Support by setting the `CONFIG_HTTPD_WS_SUPPORT` option to `y` is the `sdkconfig.defaults` file.

### WebSocket Secure (WSS) {collapsible="true"}

The server uses
ESP-IDF's [esp_https_server](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/components/esp_https_server) to handle
secure WebSocket (WSS) connections over HTTPS.

A private Root CA signs the Orchestratorâ€™s certificate, which includes its IP address in the SAN field. The client has
the Root CA certificate to verify the Orchestrator during TLS handshake.

Clients connect to `/ws`. The server performs the WebSocket handshake and upgrades the connection.

The server handles incoming WebSocket frames:

- `TEXT` echoed back
- `PING` replies with PONG
- `CLOSE` closes the connection gracefully

Outgoing messages are sent asynchronously using ESP-IDF's work queue.

### TLS Certificates {collapsible="true"}

This project requires locally generated certificates to establish a [WSS](#websocket-secure-wss) connection between the
Orchestrator and a client application.

First-time Setup (after cloning):

```Bash
chmod +x ./components/websocket_server/certs/cert_generate.sh
```

Generating Certificates:

```Bash
# Generate certificates using the default ESP32 IP (192.168.4.1):
./components/websocket_server/certs/cert_generate.sh

# Alternatively, specify a custom ESP32 IP address:
./components/websocket_server/certs/cert_generate.sh 192.168.1.50
```

### Keep-Alive Mechanism .3{collapsible="true"}

The keep-alive mechanism automatically monitors active WebSocket clients to detect and remove dead connections. It sends
periodic `PING` messages to each client and waits for a `PONG` response. If a client fails to respond within the
configured timeout, it is marked as inactive and disconnected.

The module tracks clients by their socket file descriptors and runs as a separate FreeRTOS task, using a queue to handle
client add, remove, and update events.

### Message Handling {collapsible="true"}

Incoming messages are handled by a registered [JSON parser](Messages.md).
