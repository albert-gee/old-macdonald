# Control Panel

## Overview

A **Control Panel** is a GUI application that farmers use to configure and manage system components, as well as monitor
and adjust environmental conditions.

The environment can be configured for specific crops. When setting up a new plant, farmers can choose from predefined
parameters suited to that crop. As the plant grows, they can manually adjust settings.
