The tent’s internal volume is approximately 64,512 cubic inches, which converts to about 37.34 cubic feet:
32” × 32” × 63” ÷ 1,728 ≈ 37.34 ft³

The 130 CFM inline duct fan can replace 37 cubic feet of air in about 17 seconds:
37 ft³ ÷ 130 ft³/min ≈ 0.28 minutes

For effective growing conditions, it’s recommended to perform a full air exchange every one to three minutes. This ensures fresh air circulation, stable temperature, and proper humidity levels.
