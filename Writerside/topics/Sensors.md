# Sensors

A sensor is any device that generates some sort of output when exposed to a phenomenon. 

The table below lists the sensors utilised in this project:

| **Sensor**        | **Purpose**                  |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| BMP280            | Temperature and air pressure |
| BH1750 or TSL2561 | Light intensity              |
| DHT22             | Temperature and humidity     |
| MH-Z19B           | Carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚) levels  |

The sensor devices utilise the ESP32-H2 microcontrollers with Thread connectivity and low power consumption, enabling
effective operation in various agricultural settings.
