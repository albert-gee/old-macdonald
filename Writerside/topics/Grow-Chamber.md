# Grow Chamber

## Overview

A **Grow Chamber** is a self-contained module within the system, designed to provide an independent, controlled
environment for plant growth.

## System Design

Commercially available grow tents for indoor plant cultivation function as individual **Grow Chambers**, providing
structure and isolating the growing environment.

A bucket at the centre of the tent acts as a **Root Chamber**. It contains multiple **Plant Slots** that hold net pots
filled with growing medium, where seeds are planted.

As the seeds germinate, their stems grow upward to form a canopy, while roots develop below. The **Fogponics System**
delivers a fine, nutrient-rich mist to the roots, generated by an ultrasonic mist maker submerged in a water-nutrient
solution.

**Lighting panels** positioned in the corners provide the necessary wavelengths for growth. The walls of the Tent and
the Root Chamber are lined with Mylar, a reflective material that enhances
light distribution for the plants.

The **Ventilation system** maintains airflow and regulates the temperature within the Grow chamber.

## Hardware Components

The hardware components were sourced from easily accessible suppliers, such as Canadian Tire and Amazon.
