# Accessory Devices

Firmware development for the ESP32 microcontrollers was conducted using the ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development
Framework) version 5.2.1. This open-source framework provides essential libraries and tools to create efficient,
low-power IoT applications with native Matter protocol support, enabling seamless device interoperability.

[ESP-IDF development environment](ESP-IDF-Setup.md) is required.

[ESP-Matter development environment](ESP-Matter-Setup.md) is required.

ESP32 boards communicate with sensors via the I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocol.
