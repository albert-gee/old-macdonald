# Grow Chambers

Commercially available grow tents for indoor plant cultivation function as individual Grow Chambers. The tent forms the
structure of the Grow Chamber, isolating the growing environment.

At the centre of the tent, a bucket acts as a Root Chamber that contains multiple Plant Slots. Each Plant Slot holds net
pots filled with cotton, which serves as the growing medium for the plants.

The Root Chamber uses fogponics to deliver a fine, nutrient-rich mist to plant roots. An ultrasonic mist maker is
submerged in a mixture of water and nutrient solution, producing a fine fog. The Root Chamber automatically regulates
humidity, temperature, oxygen levels, and nutrient availability based on the plants' growth stages, ensuring optimal
conditions from germination to maturity. Any excess nutrient solution is collected by a drainage system and recycled.

The growing process starts with germination, where seeds are planted in cotton within the Plant Slots integrated into
the Root Chamber. The Root Chamber supplies a nutrient-rich fog to each Plant Slot. As the seeds germinate, they develop
roots that absorb nutrients from the fog. Plant stems extend upward, forming a canopy above.

Lighting strips positioned in the corners provide the necessary wavelengths for growth, while a ventilation system
maintains airflow. The walls of the Tent and the Root Chamber are lined with Mylar, a reflective material that enhances
light distribution for the plants.

A cooling system, such as passive ventilation or small exhaust fans, helps regulate the temperature within the grow
chamber. The system utilises the data from a temperature sensor and runs the exhaust fan when the value increases above
the norm. Additionally, a heater and filter devices can be included to maintain desired air quality inside Grow
Chambers.
