# GUI

Controller Devices enable farmers to interact with the system through a web-based graphical user interface. 

The GUI was developed using the React framework. It utilises the REST API to communicate with SCADA and Matter for Orchestrators. This approach ensures that the GUI is both responsive and accessible across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
