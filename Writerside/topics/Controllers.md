# Controllers

## Overview

A **Controller** (not to be confused with [](Matter-Controllers.md)) is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows
farmers to monitor and control the environmental conditions within the system.

Controllers allow farmers to configure [](Orchestrators.md) for specific crops. Farmers can set up a new plant by
selecting predefined parameters designed for that crop. As the plant grows, they can manually adjust settings, such as
humidity, to meet its changing needs.
